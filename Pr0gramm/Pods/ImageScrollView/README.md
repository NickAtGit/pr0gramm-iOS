```  

then run below command in Terminal to install:  

`pod install`

Note: If the above pod doesn't work, try using below pod definition in Podfile:

#### Swift Package Manager

#### Manual
Sometimes just want to install manually, just simply add the file `ImageSrollView.swift` in the folder `Sources` to your project.

#### Simple to use
Drag an UIScrollView to your storyboard, change Class and Module in Identity Inspector to ImageScrollView. Also, create an IBOutlet in your source file.

![How to config ImageScrollView in storyboard](ReadMeImages/storyboard-demo.jpeg?raw=true)

```swift
import ImageScrollView
```

```swift
@IBOutlet weak var imageScrollView: ImageScrollView!
```

```swift
// Important: This setup method should be called once, usually in your viewDidLoad() method
imageScrollView.setup()

let myImage = UIImage(named: "my_image_name")
imageScrollView.display(image: myImage)
```
That's all. Now try zooming and scrolling to see the result.

You can set delegate to catch event. This delegate is inheritted from `UIScrollViewDelegate`.

```swift
imageScrollView.imageScrollViewDelegate = self
```

```swift
extension ViewController: ImageScrollViewDelegate {
    func imageScrollViewDidChangeOrientation(imageScrollView: ImageScrollView) {
        print("Did change orientation")
    }
    
    func scrollViewDidEndZooming(_ scrollView: UIScrollView, with view: UIView?, atScale scale: CGFloat) {
        print("scrollViewDidEndZooming at scale \(scale)")
    }
    
    func scrollViewDidScroll(_ scrollView: UIScrollView) {
        print("scrollViewDidScroll at offset \(scrollView.contentOffset)")
    }
}
```

### Note: 

- If you have any problem about layout, image position, make sure you have called the setup() method of the ImageScrollView. Or you can try calling the method `layoutIfNeeded()` of the view controller's view:

```swift
view.layoutIfNeeded()
```


### About this source
This open source is based on PhotoScroller demo avaiable on Apple's site. The original source was written in Objective C. This open source rewrote it by using Swift, and added some new features:
- Double tap to zoom.
- Smoother. Fixed bug when zooming out, the control auto zooms from center, and not from the corner.
